Tighter constrains - Multilayer 2oz
More relaxed constrains - Multilayer 1oz

In files where the copper weight is different for outer layers and inner layers, the inner layers must be called "Mid layer #", where # is the inner layer number starting from 1. Otherwise, the proper clearance won't be applied. If a different name is used, change the argument in the "OnLayer" parameter inside the clearance rule
